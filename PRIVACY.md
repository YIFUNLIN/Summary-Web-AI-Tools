Privacy Policy for AI Summary Tool - Web Assistant
Last Updated: February 26, 2026

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how AI Summary Tool - Web Assistant ("the Extension") handles your information.

1. Information Collection and Use
The Extension is designed to be a "serverless" tool. We do not operate any backend servers, and we do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to ourselves or any third parties, except as required for the Extension's core functionality.

A. API Keys
To use the Extension, you must provide your own API keys (e.g., Google Gemini or OpenAI).

Storage: These keys are stored exclusively in your browser's local storage (chrome.storage.local).

Usage: They are used only to authenticate requests sent directly from your browser to the respective AI providers.

B. Website Content
When you request a summary or ask a question:

The Extension extracts text content from the active tab.

This content is sent directly to the AI provider (Google or OpenAI) to generate a response.

We do not log, view, or store the content of the websites you visit.

2. Third-Party Services
The Extension interacts with the following third-party AI providers:

Google (Gemini API)

OpenAI (GPT API)

By using your own API keys, your data usage is subject to the privacy policies and terms of service of these providers. We recommend reviewing their respective privacy policies.

3. Data Security
Since all data (API keys and settings) is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on the security of your personal computer and browser. We do not have access to your local storage.

4. Permissions Justification
storage: Used to save your API keys and customized prompts locally.

activeTab / scripting: Used to read the text of the current webpage to provide summaries.

sidePanel: Used to display the AI chat interface alongside the webpage.

5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
